        <h1>Understanding Machine Learning Basics</h1>

        <p class="meta">By John Doe | November 20, 2025</p>

        <p>
          Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables
          computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. This
          technology powers everything from recommendation systems to autonomous
          vehicles.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>

        <p>
          Machine learning refers to algorithms that improve automatically
          through experience. The field has three main categories: supervised
          learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
        </p>

        <p>
          In supervised learning, algorithms learn from labeled training data.
          For example, an email spam filter learns from thousands of emails
          marked as spam or not spam.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Applications</h2>

        <p>Machine learning powers many everyday technologies:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Voice assistants like Siri and Alexa</li>
          <li>Netflix and Spotify recommendations</li>
          <li>Fraud detection in banking</li>
          <li>Medical diagnosis assistance</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>

        <p>
          To begin learning machine learning, you should have a foundation in
          mathematics, particularly linear algebra and statistics. Python is the
          most popular programming language for ML development.
        </p>

        <p>
          Popular frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. Each
          has its strengths depending on your use case.
        </p>

        <p>
          The field continues to evolve rapidly, with new breakthroughs emerging
          regularly. Staying current requires continuous learning and
          experimentation.
